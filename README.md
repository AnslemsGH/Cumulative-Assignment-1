The code uses an API to fetch information from the database and uses models to store and views to display as a web page using html.

The summary blocks correspond to the corresponding code, and comments in-line will help user better understand the code to follow in the application.

The code has been formatted so as for the output to be in a readable format. The code can be customized to output only the required fields from the table, if needed.
